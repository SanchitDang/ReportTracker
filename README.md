### Dependencies Used

- **Hibernate:** Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java that provides a mapping from Java classes to database tables and vice versa. It simplifies database programming in Java applications by eliminating the need for tedious JDBC coding. Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities.

- **Swing Framework:** Swing is a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) components for Java. It provides a rich set of controls, such as buttons, text fields, and tables, to create interactive and user-friendly desktop applications in Java. Swing components are lightweight and platform-independent, making them suitable for developing cross-platform applications.

### SQL Database

The project utilizes SQL to store data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing relational databases. It provides capabilities for querying data, defining schema, modifying data, and managing permissions. In this project, SQL is used to store employee reports, attendance, and other relevant information.
